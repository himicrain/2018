Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area. 



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades. If you're into more traditional pizza, this is THE spot to go in the ATL.",9/28/2009 4:53,0,1,2,3,2,6,9/18/2009,5,0,21,1,2,25

I visited this place because someone told me that he drove a few additional hours just to stop by this pizza place again. We ordered San Gennaro, which came with salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, and cipolline. We all liked this one much better than the other one. The other pizza that we had was Diavola. Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great... 



Antico seemed to be a popular hang out place - saw many people brought alcohol on their own. Overall, it was an okay experience for me and the pizza was priced on the expensive side. I am not sure I'd be coming again.",3/3/2011 1:33,0,1,2,3,2,6,9/18/2009,5,0,21,1,2,25

It's my family's favorite pizza restaurant to eat at and we come here every time my brother and I are back in town. I've had the Margherita and the Sophia and they are both delicious. I judge a pizza place by their Margherita because it's a simple pizza that should be done right and Antico did a great job with the Margherita. The Sophia, which is bufala, cipollini onions, roasted mushrooms, and white truffle oil, has a ton of flavor and is a great pizza for vegetarians. 



I've also been to the Alpharetta location and I thought it was just as good. The Avalon is a fun area to walk around, so I think it's a great location for the restaurant.",6/30/2010 17:42,0,1,2,3,4,3,6/13/2010,5,0,30,1,2,86

We got the lasagna pizza, the spinach/brocolli pizza, and a pepperoni with peppers pizza (I don't remember the actual unique names they give them). They all were absolutely delicious, the pizza is of true Italian origin. Light sauce, cheese is spread out not just thrown all over the pizza, same goes for the other toppings. Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing. 



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy. 



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza. 



Would I go back? Yes, but only if it's a work outing and the company is paying, cause if you get two pizzas you're looking at $50! Ah! The pizza is absolutely delicious though, if you haven't been, go and splurge at least one here.",1/18/2010 16:44,0,1,2,3,4,3,6/13/2010,5,0,30,1,2,86

I remember feeling a tinge of jealousy that Georgia Tech kids get to party with authentic Neapolitan pizza, while the rest of us are stuck with your bland, run-of-the-mill delivery pizza. 



Many years have gone by, and I still remember this place fondly. Upon my most recent visit, I learned that 1) most of their pizza costs over $20, 2) they have expanded their dining area by opening up the kitchen, and 3) they don't have dry oregano sprigs and peperonata on the table for you to garnish your pizza with anymore. Simultaneously, I was ecstatic to see that Antico is still thriving and that their pizza is still excellent. The quality of the ingredients is superb: the sauce made using the San Marzano tomatoes is pleasantly acidic, the crust is perfectly charred, and the bufala mozzarella is creamy. If this doesn't make you salivate, I don't know what will. 



Although they offer various different pizzas, I only order Margheriat D.O.P. As the famous saying goes, less is more. If you can handle spice, I would recommend Diavola; the addition of soppressata and peperonata packs a punch and flavor. 



In my experience, it is absolutely the best to eat their pizza right out of the oven, piping hot. So I would recommend dining in, rather than doing a take-out. No matter the day, they are extremely busy. However, with the glorious Acunto Napoli brick ovens sitting in their kitchen, they are capable of popping out their pizza really quickly - so the wait won't be bad at all.",8/1/2009 23:24,0,1,2,3,5,3,11/7/2010,5,1,26,1,NA,144

After you order, half the kitchen is reserved for guest seating. Pick a table. The pizza came out in minutes shockingly. We ordered 4 pizzas for 7 people and it was plenty. $20 ish dollars apiece.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted.



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted.



Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?



This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted.



Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?



This is a close one, but I ever so slightly prefer DeSano Pizza to Antico, and Antico falls just short of my top spot Tony's in San Francisco. No Star Granted.",3/12/2011 22:39,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181

The verdura pizza is what called our names. It came out fairly fast, with all kinds of great add ons. I can't talk about the food until I talk about the atmosphere though.



You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table.



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together.

Once we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air.



We had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time.

Yet, Antico Pizza delivers. First you order whichever pizza you desire at the counter. Next, pick a seat. Then your pizza literally makes its way to your table. Be sure to grab peppers, cheese, olive oil, and garlic towards where they make the pizza too.



We ordered the truffle mushroom pizza for $27, which is only being offered for a limited time. It was really delicious. The flavor and aroma of truffle and mushrooms was almost too much to handle! Every bite was so good. You just want to keep eating more. Before you know it, the whole pizza has been devoured!



Seriously, if you want lightning fast pizza with quality ingredients, this place will surely amaze. My only criticism is that the bottom of the pizza is too flimsy/soggy.

The best part about this place is that it's BYOB, so grab a bottle of wine/pack of beer & some buddies and head on over!!



Now onto the food, you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but my favorite is the classic margherita. I usually like to add some extra toppings such as pepperoni or sausage, but it's delicious just by itself too! All of their pizzas are pretty simple (not too many crazy toppings), but they are all so savory (again... it's the sauce!) that you really don't need the extra toppings!



Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;)

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.
