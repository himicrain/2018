Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area. 



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades.

I visited this place because someone told me that he drove a few additional hours just to stop by this pizza place again. We ordered San Gennaro, which came with salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, and cipolline. We all liked this one much better than the other one. The other pizza that we had was Diavola. Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great... 



Antico seemed to be a popular hang out place - saw many people brought alcohol on their own. Overall, it was an okay experience for me and the pizza was priced on the expensive side. I am not sure I'd be coming again.",8/9/2010,124,6,6,7,7,7,11/1/2010,6.6,1,49,1,NA,107

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico) 

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis) 

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns).

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. 



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. 



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time. 



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine. 



I just won't come here again. It's just not my type of place, but to each is own.",1/24/2010,27,7,6,6,6,5,7/23/2010,6,1,23,1,NA,146

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? 



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted. 



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? 



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted. 



Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? 



This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted. 



Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could? 



This is a close one, but I ever so slightly prefer DeSano Pizza to Antico, and Antico falls just short of my top spot Tony's in San Francisco. No Star Granted.",1/21/2010,322,4,4,4,5,7,4/4/2010,4.8,1,37,2,NA,54

The verdura pizza is what called our names. It came out fairly fast, with all kinds of great add ons. I can't talk about the food until I talk about the atmosphere though. 



You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table. 



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together.

Once we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air. 



We had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time.

Not much more to say. I have eaten pizza all over the US and Europe, Italy included. Antico's is just that great. You order at the counter and proceed to find a seat. They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right. 



Now besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices. 



Now seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!)

They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max. 

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves. 



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D 



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance! 



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.

Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing. 



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy. 



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza.

You go up to the counter, order your pies, get a drink, grab a seat if there isn't a line and then they yell out your number. There are condiments aka garlic, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and hot peppers by the ovens to which you can help yourself. 



Knocked off one star because of two reasons. First, I understand this can't be helped but they don't allow split pizzas-aka one side one style and the other half another style. So if you're a veg eater and your Boo eats meat, you gotta just get two pies. 



Secondly, why are the dang pies so expensive?! This isn't NYC. For a pie, the price is anywhere from $18-20. They sell hundreds of pies a day. So much profit. I wish they were more plebian-friendly. It makes the whole experience centered on hipster-, nouveau riche-, Subaru-driving people only.

I always order the margherita. 

Crust, sauce and cheese with basil. Everything was perfect. 

The establishment is half the fun--it's lively, the kitchen is a constant flurry of cooks, busboys and customers. You typically will eat right in the kitchen! The 3 large stone ovens are within sight and you can watch your pizza get made. the kitchen is set up with large benches so you eat in close proximity to other patrons if it is busy. 



It's not a romantic establishment by any means but it can still be a great date night. If you don't want to deal with the crowd (which I actually quite enjoyed) then get it to go. You don't have to order ahead--it is that fast and it'd probably taste better fresher. 



Pizzas are ready in about 5 minutes. I've never seen a more efficient restaurant but with excellent food. I will definitely be back next year during dragon con 2018!

Another highlight is the toppings bar - spicy peppers, freshly ground pepper and red pepper, garlic, olive oil, chili oil, and of course, parmesan. There's nothing better than devouring your pizza and then being able to drench your chewy, smoky crust in garlic. Perfection. 



The vibe is quite hectic - but it's a fun vibe. There's always a line but it goes really fast. You have to wait for a table, but again, spots open up quickly. One downside is the parking, which is quite sparse in the lot as well as the street parking. it's worth it, just be prepared to stalk a spot or uber. Which brings me to my next point. 



They of course sell beer and wine, but Antico's is also BYOB, making it a great place for you and a group of friends to crack open bottles on bottles.

Before you go to Antico, you need to expect a few things so you will have a good time. Mostly, just know that it's not your average pizza place. 



Seating is quite limited. You may have to share a table with people you don't know. Also, you may want to plan to take your pizza to go as backup, but you can bring your pizza to tables nearby outside (such as the café across the street). 



It's pretty loud. It gets super busy, and most of the indoor seating is in a pretty echo-y room. 



If you order to go, listen closely for them to call your order. This goes along with how loud it is in there. A few people didn't hear when their orders were ready. 



Some people may see these traits as negative, but to me, they are just part of a unique and delicious pizza experience. 



My only real negatives were related to service and price. You sort of need an orientation to eat there ""correctly,"" and the cashier seemed a little put out with our questions. Also, it's a little on the sorbet side for pizza, but I won't deny that it's really good product.

Their thin-crust masterpieces are baked to perfection in an imported Sicilian oven, lathered with a fabulous assortment of sauces, cheeses, peppers, and served piping hot to your table. Their San Gennaro pie is my favorite, with Italian sausage, mozzarella and hot peppers. The more traditional Margherita, a basic serving of sauce, basil and cheese, is also excellent. There's also a modest wine and bottled beer selection to pair with your meal. 



The setting isn't fancy -- most of the long communal tables are in the kitchen, so you can watch these pizza artisans work while you wait for your meal. Ample outdoor seating is also available in a patio across the street, next to their wonderful coffee and dessert shop.

Whoever the cashier was, she was not polite to any new patron.

Sadly, my experience did not measure up. 



First, the pizza. Ingredients were okay, but not amazing. The cook on both pizzas was very uneven, like they forgot to turn them before one side burned. The other sides came out undercooked. The sauce was thin and poorly distributed. The middle of the pie was soggy upon serving. 



Other considerations: 



The counter service is poorly thought out. 

Do I grab my own drink? What will you bring to the table? Where are the cups? What if I just want water? How is wine served? Why is this so freaking hard? 



The HVAC can't keep up. 

We went in May and the place was burning up inside. Too hot to be comfortable or maintain an appetite. We ended up leaving after we ate our first slices. 



The seating is tortuous. 

Clearly they want you to pay, eat, and leave immediately. No seats with backs. Just hard backless benches and stools that make your butt and back hurt. Not even remotely relaxing. 



The noise never stops. 

I understand that rampant shouting is was passes for ""vibrancy"" in restaurants today, but it's a trend I hate and one that hope will die soon. You can't have a conversation with your meal. It's just too damned loud.

Pros: PIZZA duh, fast 

Cons: seatings, self-service (water, seasonings, sides), price 



I visited here probably for ten times, and I can only imagine going here more. 

SERVICE: When I walk in, I am always greeted by the cashiers. They're nice and helpful when choosing what to eat because the menu is in Italian. I often opt for margherita (fresh mozzarella with basil) or meat-with-red-pepper pizzas. Maybe I should memorize pizza names by now. // After you order, you can sit anywhere in the store, and wait until someone calls your order number! They always serve you in a large tin tray. 

FOODS: Mine came out always in less than 15 minutes. While you're waiting, go grab your water near the kitchen, and sides {parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, salt, olive oil, and spicy peppers}. The dough is chewy and perfect. The things ON THE PIZZA tend to be salty, including but not limited to its tomato sauce, sausage, and peppers. The crusts on the bottom may be burnt and your fingers may be turned black and ashy. Portion size wise, if you get full after eating 3 Papa Johns Pizza, you may need to eat half of the pizza. Antico's pizzas are thin, and moist in the center. 



I heard the flour comes from Italy! And the owner owns other restaurants, too. There was a news about Antico's closing due to legal issues with the owner, but it's still up and open! I hope this place never closes. Few suggestions to the restaurant is - expand the place with outdoor seatings and make larger pizzas so people can share with less price.

You order your pizza at the register then go inside and pick a table. The tables are long picnic tables and so you may have to get cozy with others. That's ok though, it's good to meet other people.

Antico is community seating in a very loud and very boisterous room in the back. If you're sensitive to noise, perhaps somewhere else would be better for you.

Pricing: the pizzas are NOT cheap first of all. However they are very large and feed a lot of people. For us there was 20 and we ordered 7 pizzas so it wasn't TOO bad. 



Pizza: overall the pizza was pretty good! I wasn't too fond of the burnt tasting crust on just about every slice and a lot of us left the crust uneaten. The toppings were interestingly thrown on. Some slices had a massive bunch of tomatoes or pepperonis and some had like little to none. Lol. 



Service: service was SUPER QUICK. Like wow. Couldn't believe how fast they were. And I'm pretty sure they make to order because you can taste it.

It was slightly undercooked but I believe that's what they go for. The two of us almost finished an entire pizza!

But, as soon as you walk inside, you definitely get a wiff of delicious flavors. 

We got the margarita pizza. Mmm, it was good! The style, amount of sauce seems to stay true to real Italian style pies. If you have had naan before, it feels like you're eating naan. The number of ingredient was lacking but taste fresh. 

The staff was friendly at the counter. Great vibe all in all. To be honest, I feel like it was a bit too expensive for the taste/flavors.

e8f75f979ae747a057de4fccda9c3264,19463689,"So I've lived in Atlanta for almost 7 years, and yet, I'd never experienced Antico. I know, I know.....it's been a long time coming, but finally I got there. My pizza demon got too strong, and I succumb to the pressure, and went for pizza on Sunday afternoon. Besides the fact that the pizza was AWESOME, I hadn't heard anything about Antico. This review is more about what they are missing, versus what you actually get. Yes, the pizza is AH-MAZ-ING...like, INCREDIBLE....probably the best pizza I've had outside of NYC. If you want a great pie, you cannot go wrong with Antico. Period. Now, for what I wasn't prepared for: 



So immediately, the menu seemed way too complex to be a pizza shop. I get it...they want to keep the integrity of the Italian theme and ingredients, and I dig it, but it took me way too long to figure out how to order the pizza I wanted. Even with the help of the staff, it took a while for me to understand. There aren't any substitutions, so what you see is exactly what you get, and you will deal, or you will go elsewhere. At some point, I believe folks will just go elsewhere. You cannot customize your pie in any way....again, WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). I asked about having a pie with half marinara, and half ""white"" sauce, and was told that wasn't possible. That was disappointing. And again, I get designing a menu for an experience, and wanting the patron to have the most authentic experience possible, but I also want the freedom to make my own choices with my pie! LOL LOL. I was also disappointed that there was no fountain drinks....yup, only bottles, and no ice....seriously...you don't have ICE for the drinks? Yes, they are cold, but again, what's the issue with having some convenience. Finally, the price point is pretty high for pizza. I ordered a margherita pizza and added pepperoni ($4 upcharge), with a Coke Zero.....I paid over $29!

We always order the Diablo pizza that has spicy calabrese peppers and spicy meat. It's literally life changing. 

Having the small condiments bar in the 'kitchen' to grab extra toppings is key. 



Raw garlic & extra calabrese peppers?

Thankfully, we had brought our own bottle of wine which we opened (no corkage fee) and had a little pre-pizza drink from the complimentary plastic cups. 



The pizza that we ordered, the Diavola, had red sauce, hot peppers, and spicy sorpressata. It came out on a large tray and we huddled over it as we devoured it. The dough was downright divine, slightly crusty and blackened around the edges but still soft somehow. Toppings were nice too. Pizza was definitely 5 stars. Will come back again.

The only down sides is that it's a little bit crowded and loud, which probably prevents it from being an optimal experience.

I had a hard time rating this place please because everytime I go it has been different.

Their pizza is delicious and their crust is a perfect mix of chewy and crispy but I did not pay the money for bread. So the 3rd time I came prepared and asked them at the front to make sure there isn't such a huge crust. He suggested I ask for extra sauce and cheese to make that happen so I did... well the crust was again too large and then the pizza was soggy. 



It seems like all I am doing is ranting so why the 4 stars? BECAUSE ITS FREAKIN GOOD! The 60% pizza I got, in all its glory with toppings and sauce, was so good I could easily finish a whole pizza by myself. I will continue to come here and beg that I don't get such a crustful pizza, and one day, my prayers might be answered and I think I will have found the perfect pizza.

Smells of basil and garlic swirling through the air. I found out later that Antico is BYOB which would have been awesome to know prior to visiting so I wanted to make sure and share that here!! 



The many reviews and sites I scoured pointed us to two pizzas in particular, the San Gennaro and the Lasagna. Both were out of this world!! The crust is perfectly crispy with just the right amount of char but also soft and chewy. Toppings were flavorful and plentiful, while cheese was fresh made and delicioso!! 



Antico's is a bit on the pricey side but it's worth it because it's damn delicious and after your pizza you can head over to the Gelateria for some dessert!!",1/12/2010,78,5,5,6,6,6,6/10/2010,5.6,1,18,1,1,1229

My wife and I visited recently and ordered the San Gennaro, which came recommended by the cashier (side note: I see quite a few people have mentioned the service was bad, I thought it was perfectly acceptable). We sat at a large table with several other guests and chatted with everyone until our pie arrived (about 10 minutes). The crust really sells the pizza; it's chewy with a slightly charred outside and excellent flavor. The sweet peppers complimented the salty sausage well. Cheese was on point. 



I also really liked the condiment bar. Located near the kitchen is a small counter top set up with cheese, pepper, and minced garlic. I used a little of all three on every slice and it was magical. 



One of my gripes has to do with drinks, but it's a minor one. The drinks were expensive so we went with water. We could not locate any ice and had to walk back near the bathrooms and pour ourselves tap water into these tiny disposable cups. In other words, I had to make a trip every five seconds to grab room temperature tap water. Not really a huge fan of that. Since everyone sits together at giant tables, carafes or pitchers that could be shared would really help out! Bonus points for being BYOB, though, and I will take advantage of that next time. 



My bigger gripe has to do with the fact that, despite it being delicious, the pizza gave me the worst stomach cramps in recent memory and quite a bit of digestive distress. I'll give Antico's another shot but I'm hoping to not have a redo.",9/23/2010,391,5,6,6,4,5,3/18/2011,5.2,1,24,1,1,106

Although I liked the taste of the pizza and the communal style eating was cool. It is definitely not the best pizza I've tasted in Atlanta, but it rates in the top 5. I was not a fan of the lack of pizza variations. I guess I've been spoiled by chain pizza establishments where I can get multiple topping choices on my pizza and so I was not thrilled about paying $26 for a pizza that I could only have one meat, either pepperoni or sausage, on it. Also, it is one size fits all. You can not choose small or medium, only large. The seating is quite limited which makes the communal style, catch as catch can seating and eating a bit cumbersome, especially if you come with a group. The pizza comes to your table via a large silver pan. There are NO plates and the cups and cutlery are plastic. Also, when I asked for some water I was directed to the sink that was off to the side of the room. Now, on a great note, it is BYOB! That is a major plus!!

I had seen so much hype about Antico on Yelp that I thought I'd give it try. They do not have single slices so you have to order a whole pizza (they only offer one size). I ordered the most popular pizza, San Gennaro ($22) to-go. I called ahead to place my order and gave the women my name. When I went in to pick it up the woman at the register said that they don't take name they give you a number and even then they don't start cooking your pizza until you come in and pay for it. So basically don't think you're going to save any time by calling ahead. 



The restaurant had a pretty cool layout. It was community-style seating right next to the ovens so you can see the chefs making your pizza. It's also a BYOB spot. 



However, when I got home I was surprised by how basic and un-exciting my pizza tasted. Initially I didn't like it at all because I wasn't expecting it to be so sweet and there were no more than 5 pieces of sausage on the entire pizza. But I stuck my pizza in the oven for about 10 mins to get it crispy and it tasted a little better. The pizzas in the restaurant looked like they we're cooked crispy however the to-go pizza was as well-done as Domino's. 



Overall, very regular pizza. Nothing exciting. I'll stick to Fellini's.",3/4/2010,61,5,5,6,6,2,10/7/2010,4.8,0,29,1,NA,137

It's just scrumptious pizzas and tap water from a sink/BYOB at Antico. Order at the counter, tip with cash, sit down next to strangers, and keep your ears open for your number. 



I've noshed on these three pizzas, in order of most favored to somewhat less favored: 

San Gennaro (salsiccia/sausage, dolce piccante pepper/peppadews?, bufala/mozzarella, cipolline/onions) $22--My favorite so far, but I've been eyeing the lasagna for next time. Excellent sauce, yummy sausage. Liked the peppers. The crust is superb. 



Napoletana (broccoli rabe, salsiccia, bufala) $21--This pizza doesn't come with tomato sauce. I missed the sauce, but I really liked the huge hunks of sausage and felt semi-healthy for eating vegetables. Recommended. 



Diavola (spicy sopressata, pepperonata, bufala), $22--Spice lovers, this is your pie. A little too hot for me, but those with more tolerant tongues will be pleased. 



Pizzas are slightly salty. Antico chars the crust a bit so you will end up with sooty smudges on your fingers, if you're not a knife and forker. The pizzas are thin and have about eight slices to a pie. A person could eat roughly half of a pie; the pizzas come in just one size. 



Don't show up too late since the dough sometimes runs out. The women taking your orders and bringing you your pies are detached but not rude or anything. There is a wee parking lot right in front of the entrance, and there's a bigger one that wraps around the building, with the entrance on Ethel Street.

We headed to the main dining area (with the open kitchen) and stood by the walk-in freezer for a few minutes, as every table was full. (If you are sitting at a table, it seems that the general rule is to avoid eye contact with standing folks waiting to be seated.) Our pizzas came out; panic set in - we were still standing. 



A member of the kitchen staff led us to the back ""table,"" which isn't really a nice table. It's steel and there are no chairs/stools. But there are paper towels and utensils, so we didn't complain!

The main dining area consists of about four communal dining tables and a couple of bar tables in front of the kitchen and ovens. It's also byob so you can bring your favorite six pack or bottle of wine to accompany the meal.

Unfortunately, the short wait time for food leaves you with less time to find a seat at this often packed, seat-yourself establishment. On the bright side, there's plenty of street parking on Hemphill and a decently sized parking lot, so parking isn't a huge issue. However, if you hate being surrounded by other people, you might want to stay away during the dinner rush. Alternatively, you can get your pie to go, head east down 14th and make a mid-afternoon picnic of it at Piedmont Park.

While the ordering and finding a table process can be a little stressful for a newcomer, it's totally worth it for the DIVINE pizza experience. The fact that you can bring your own bottle of wine in definitely eases the process as well. The front staff could definitely be a little friendlier, but I understand that they're trying to move people in and out pretty quickly. I would NOT recommend eating there during the summer though, as the back dining room can get VERY hot, but it's great to pick and up and go or to even take across the street and eat while you order gelato.

We had three different pizzas for a good selection. The picnic table style family seating was an issue as we could not find space to sit together and ended up at different tables. The pizza is pricey (over priced in my opinion) and for me anyway it is hard to eat and enjoy a meal with people staring at me because the want my seat. Glad I tried it..... but not likely to go back. That said, I have a hard time understanding how it ranks so highly among Atlanta's restaurants.

This is a total neighborhood pizza joint, I went on a Saturday night for dinner and it was packed! The line was literally almost coming out the door and might I remind you that this place can seat a good 50-80 people. As soon as I walked in I saw everyone holding their own beers and wine as they do not serve alcohol here so I actually left the line with my buddy and went to the gas station around the block and grabbed a 6pack of that Perroni Italian Beer to match with this authentic Italian pizza. 



So let me start by saying the line moves fairly quickly because of the fact that they use some legit ovens imported from Italy that cook these thin pies in about a min or so. I ordered the San Gennaro based on alot of reviews and it did not disappoint. While waiting for my pizza and fighting to look for a table to sit at I saw they had a little condiment section which is self serve. They had fresh garlic / olive oil / spicy chili garlic sauce / and of course parmesan cheese. They somehow find you in the midst of a 100 people and scream out your order number as its pretty loud in there. I believe Georgia Tech is right near by so there was alot of young people there and it was very lively. 



Honestly this is the type of joint you can go to on the weekends as a casual hang out or even on a date. The people that were sitting in front of me, a party of 6 were from New York and we were talking about all the great pies we've had as I travel to alot of different states and look for the best pizzeria every place I visit. They couldnt stop telling me how good the pizza is and how it was even better than the stuff in New York. This place is by far the best authentic italian pizza ive ever had and we didnt leave a single slice on this huge pie.

My friend and I were able to see the chefs do all their prep and cooking right in front of us and I absolutely love that concept anywhere! 



For $23 I couldn't believe they give you cups just so that you can go to the sink and fill up your complimentary water. I know I'll get tap regardless, but I don't think I should have to walk up to a sink and fill my own cup.

Location - The layout is weird with just one ""main"" dining table like they only expected people to do take out when they first opened. Throughout the years, they've added more tables and chairs to the kitchen area. One thing if it's cold outside, the kitchen is the warmest spot in the place. Now, if you're here and it's summer - get plenty of water and wear short sleeve clothes. It's going to be a slight sauna. 



Service - Order at the counter, food is brought to you if you can find a seat. Don't be a snob please and share your table if you have room for anyone asking. 



All the times I've been here and brought someone who has visited prior, the San Gennaro is the pizza that everyone loves. I don't think I've tried any other topping combination besides the basic margarita. 



Yes, drinks are a little over priced. I usually get the blood orange san pellegrino. Slightly sweet but still mellow. The coke bottles are small and not really worth it. 



I've also had the chocolate cannolis, but I think saving room for gelato is more worth it.

Seriously, though, my lady and I devour an entire pie about every other week or so, and Antico's pizzas make our lives that much better. 

***** 

I. FOOD & DRINK 

Can't really go wrong with any of the pies here. Why? Well, they consistently make amazing dough that comes out wonderfully soft and beautifully airy. And the sauce? It has a great balance of sugar, salt, and spice. Whatever else you put on it, it's bound to be great. Oh, and the cheeses they use are fantastic as well. Pizzas I've destroyed: 



*Capriciossa: with mushroom, artichoke, prosciutto cotto, and bufala, it's easily one of my favorites. Earthy, savory, cheesy, and fleshy - it has it all. 



*Diavola: spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala - spicy, meaty pizza is always good. A favorite as well. 



*San Gennaro: with salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala, and cippoline, this baby also rocks. 



Regarding drinks, they have your basic Coke products, as well as different flavored San Pellegrino's. But the real kick-a***ness is that patrons are allowed to BYOB. So, you'll see people bring in some nice bottles of reds - even with their own glasses sometimes - and get down. 



BTW, across the street, they have this gorgeous, quaint pasticceria ideal for fun dates with a loved one during the Spring, Summer or Fall. Shoot, I sort of like this building more than the pizza joint. Things to know: they have some bomb as hell coffee, as well as marvelous cannolis. Can't go wrong with the gelato either. Oh, and definitely take advantage of the scooter they have outside. A chubby dude like me looks ridiculous on one of those things. 



II. SERVICE 

For whatever reason, the service... well, is poor. During the handful of times I've waited in line - either during the weekday or weekend - there always seems to be an issue. It's either one of the following: 



1) The cashiers enter the incorrect order, and we have to accept a pizza that was not the one you wanted because when you complain about it they say they can't do anything; 



2) Your pizzas are taken by other people that claim to have the same name. 



3) The cashiers exude snarky, eye-rolling rudeness (which I usually don't mind). If the service was fast or even consistent, I would let a lot of things slide. But it's not. 



I do admit, though, three of the eight or so times I've been there no problems have occurred. They seem to be rare, though. 



III. ATMOSPHERE/ DÉCOR 

It's Hunger Games-like when that line forms, and the steaming inside seating area is scarce. Opt to take the pizzas to go, unless you visit during non-peak hours. 



IV. PRICES 

Pizzas run around $20 or north of it. The deliciousness is definitely worth your hard earned cash, though. 



V. OVERALL 

Absolutely stunning flavas, but the chaos and rudeness are ridiculous. So, my lady and I use Favor to have someone get the pizzas for us. That runs us about $10+, for someone to do that. And we think that it's worth it.",1/25/2010,303,3,4,6,3,7,11/19/2010,4.6,0,23,1,2,35

The restaurant is always busy around the clock; the line was out the door when my party got there (5pm on a Saturday). Wait time however was pretty quick, and seats weren't all too hard to find. It's BYOB, but if you forget, they also sell a few beverages, like pellegrino. If you're too cheap for drinks, they have plastic cups at each table, and faucet water to drink (literally they pointed to a faucet when I asked for water). 



They don't come short when it comes to the quality of ingredients. The whole business is entirely transparent. There's a rack of proofing dough in plain sight when you walk into the dining room, and ovens blazing in the back. The toppings were even top notch qualities, the pickled peppers were tasty, garlic was fresh, and the parmesan was good (I got an extra cup to eat separately). 



The pizzas are roughly $20 a pie. That's kinda pricey, for a student like me. It's roughly a medium size delivery pizza, and can feed 2 people comfortably (they're not that small). From what I read in the reviews, there are 3 pizzas that yelpers would die for. If you wanna be safe, go for the margherita pizza. If you're fine with anything, get the San Gennaro. If you're a bit adventurous, order the Diavola. The pizzas come out really quick, so find seats ASAP. 



DIAVOLA - $21 

So I ordered the diavola pizza with my girlfriend. The pizza was topped with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. In English, it was topped with some fancy pepperoni, spicy peppers, and fancy mozzarella cheese (sorry guys). The sopressata salami tasted a lot like regular pepperoni, just a tad bit more fattier and more savory, but not a whole lot difference. The peppers were a nice addition, and had a little sweetness that added to the pizza. The bufala tasted like regular mozzarella, I couldn't really tell the difference. The problem I had with this pizza was that it was really salty. I didn't taste any balance in flavors, just the saltiness from the sopressata. To add to that, the pizza was a bit on the dry side and oily on top, contributing to the need for water or some other beverage. The crust was a bit thick for me, compared to the rest of the pizza. 



I tried the margherita pizza, which I thought was better than the diavola pizza. It was simple and classic: not much you can mess up on. Also, try to eat the pizzas as quickly as possible, as they tend to turn soggy the longer you wait. In the end, I wasn't amazed by the pizzas, they were just okay. Basically my two cents is this: as a yelper virgin to authentic Italian food, I'm not sure if this place is worth the hype. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm in the area, but for now, I'd suggest trying one of the other amazing restaurants in Midtown.",3/18/2010,85,3,2,5,6,7,8/19/2011,4.6,1,20,1,NA,265

The prices were outrageous for pizza as were their small 6.5 oz coke bottles for $2.75 each. You cannot make any substitutions at all, out of the question when I asked. 



The 4 cheese calzone was noting like a typical calzone, a real disappointment and oozing oil that made the bottom soggy after 5 minutes. The pizza has no crispness under but rather a softer texture which also got soggy after 5 minutes. 



For 1 pizza and 1 calzone to cost over $50.00 with a few sodas, I would of expected a lot better. If you see my other reviews, I never mind spending $$$$ on food but for Pizza, it's a ton of hype or a ton of people who haven't had other Italian pizza from real Italians ( not a single one here, they all spoke Spanish in back ). 



The gelato across the street was also ok. No tasting allowed so don't ask and the salted caramel had ZERO salt flavor, just tasted like bland caramel, so nothing special and definitely not salted as it should be. 



Save your money. Don't get me wrong, it was ok, nothing bad, but I wouldn't be jumping up and down telling people to go here.",6/6/2010,89,4,5,6,6,3,6/10/2010,4.8,1,51,3,NA,102

Two of my girl friends and I split the $22 San Gennaro pizza which had Italian sausage, sweet red pepper, mozzarella, and onions. It was so large that we were all full and still had another slice left over. Another great thing about this place is that it's BYOB and provide plastic cups so we brought 2 bottles of wine to go with our meal. The seating is also worth noting since it's communal, family style seating. 



The parking situation isn't bad as they have several little lots that you can park at. We parked at the Antico corporate office lot.

They don't give you plates so you eat out of the box( not a bad thing but not what I expected from the #1 pizza joint in Atlanta). 

We got home and the pizza was already cold. It was a 10 minute drive home.... The crust seemed to be pre-made and was burnt on the bottom. The pepperoni is in chunks so you get crust little sauce and a mouthful of just pepperoni.

You order your pie and go to the back in communal seating to eat it. You can watch them make it and it's a nice show. Minimal ingredients. Superb toppings (we got a pepperoni and a plain). The pies are very filling and the dough is unreal. 

I had no problems with their service as I read with some reviews. And it didn't take a long time to get the pizza. What I do know is the place has killer lines during lunch time.

What I see is a restaurant that probably delivered in quality and experienced before it got hit with high reviews and explosive amount of business. And it has just not delivered he quality pizza, probably because it has too much business. Ironic huh? 



Specifically, I've been back 4 more times since my first review. And 4 times I've gotten pizza that's thin, soggy, sometimes okay, but never close to the expectations set by the reviews I see.

They loved the pizza here. We ordered 4 different ones to try out. We ordered the Lasagna, Margherita D.O. P., Diavola, and San Gennaro. 



The Margherita pizza has San Marzano tomato, bufala, basil and garlic on it. My fave! I usually ask for more fresh basil and lay it on my pizza, fold my pizza over and dip it in the oil that I make. I use spicy olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese to make a dipping sauce. It is a bit spicy but I love a pizza with a kick. 



The Lasagna pizza has meatballs, ricotta and romano on it. This was my fiancé's favorite one. 



The San Gennaro has salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala and cipolline on it. This was the least popular one. 



The Diavola has spicy sopressata, pepperonata and bufala on it. This was our friend's fave one. It was a bit spicy so you really don't need the spicy oil dip for this one! He liked it because it was spicy. 



I was super hungry when I ordered 4. It was way too much pizza for 4 people. Next time we will order 2. Their portion is large, their pizza is not small.

The ingredients are fresh, the crust/dough is flavorful, the restaurant has lots of character. The service is quick. Although you will most likely encounter long lines, you will not wait long for food at all. 



I've had the San Gennaro and Diavola pizzas. If I find myself at Antico again in the near future (because, let's face it, everybody seems to want to check this place out nowadays...so I'm sure friends will make me go again at some point) I will try one of the white pizzas.

As my brother was ordering the pizza, I looked for seats. Found some within 5mins. A friendly couple was kind enough to slide over so 6 of us can sit together. We were there on a Monday evening around 7:30pm and the place was full. We were excited, super hungry and tired from all the walking during the day. 



As we were looking around, we thought that the pizza was huge so we decided to just order one pizza since I typically eat only a slice or two of pizza. We ordered the San Gennaro first. It came out in less than 15mins. We started eating it and decided to go ahead and order another one. We ordered the Margherita. Both were the most popular ones we've seen. 



Overall, I thought the pizza was just okay. It wasn't anything as exciting as people said. I would have liked for the crust to be a little more crispy. Having said that, the taste of it was good.

Also the web site say they open at 11:00 so I ordered at 11:30 and arrived at 11:45 to find out they don't open until 12:00. Won't be back.,1/21/2010,210,6,6,7,5,6,6/28/2011,6,1,21,2,1,7

979b97f5ee8e9477c0dbae715d833725,10805812,"Best pizza in Atlanta (and I've been told better than the pizza in itlay). 



Food: if you eat pork, I'd recommend the San Genarro. The peppers are both sweet and spicy and the sausage is perfectly cooked. If you don't eat pork, I'd go with the Pomodorini which is a white pizza with cherry tomatoes that are melting on top. All Antico pizzas have a thin crust with char on the edges. Most pizzas will run you about $20 and they feed 2 hungry people well (3 if you're not as hungry). 



PRO TIP: use the toppings station in the kitchen area. I like to mix garlic, Parmesan, red pepper, and olive oil. People who LIKE Antico don't use toppings. People who LOVE Antico do. 



Quirks: they won't change any pizza (substitutions, removing toppings, adding toppings, etc) so don't bother asking. 



Ambiance: this place is informal, crowded (unless you go at an off time), and loud. Listen carefully for your number. You'll eat off your pizza tray. There are rolls of paper towels to use as napkins. There are also cups that you can fill with water at the sinks if you don't buy a drink or BYO wine/beer which is allowed!). Don't worry if here's a long line out front since it moves faster than you think. There are tents and heaters to protect you from the weather. 



Overall this place is awesome if you want something casual and authentic.",11/7/2010,89,5,3,6,6,6,11/29/2010,5.2,1,16,3,NA,285

It was busy but not as crazy as I worried it would be, about 1230 on a Thu. We were able to get a whole table to ourselves, and I noticed others mostly could as well. One note- right now, they are card only - I found that odd bc I would have expected the opposite, but just so you know if you go in the next bit, be prepared! 



Our margherita with mushrooms was delicious - and I scored the leftover piece!- and all is wonderful in the world of thin, just-right-blistered pizza. One note- I think our ""server"" (it's not the right title because it's a person taking the order at the front but I am not sure what to say - orderer-ee?) said we could only add one topping - we were going to do mush and pepperoni but had to pick....maybe we misunderstood but whatever happened, we only had one topping.

This place hit is on all cylinders. And even though it was on a street with 3 other pizza places, this place was steady busy with in house and to go orders. 

We got the Meatball pizza, and it was so tasty. Has that floppy, but still fully cooked, crust that is a favorite of new york style pizza lovers. 

Easy enough to find a table to share with others. Bring your own wine or beer is totally acceptable. Parking is a little tricky. They are faster at delivering the pizza than you would expect...probably only 10 min for pizza to come when it is one of their standard favorites with no odd requests.",1/5/2010,373,1,7,7,6,7,4/19/2010,5.6,0,32,5,NA,95

There are strong preferences in the pizza world whether it be Chicago or NY style, but regardless of previous preference going in, once you try Antico you'll be won over. 



Welcome to Italian style. All ingredients are imported. The dough is charred yet chewy. The toppings are fresh. Dip the crust in some EVOO and crushed garlic as you wonder where this has been all your life. 



Made to order and thrown into a brick oven set to inferno churns out a perfect pizza in a very quick timeframe. You can accompany it with a bottle of wine if your bring it yourself.
