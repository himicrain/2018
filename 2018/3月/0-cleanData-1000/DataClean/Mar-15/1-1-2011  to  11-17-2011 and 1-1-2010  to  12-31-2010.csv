We came on a Saturday around 11:30. They do not open until noon, so we had to wait in line outside. They brought out a sample pizza for all of us in line to have, which I greatly appreciated. It was so delicious it made me want to beat down the door even more. 



Once we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air. 



We had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time. 



I also love the fresh Parmesan, peppers, and other ingredients they leave out for you to dress every pizza bite with. 



Probably the best pizza I've ever had.",9/28/2011,403,2,1,5,1,5,11/22/2011,2.8,1,21,1,1,414
e1c08e49cccc3a2816ab0f141d9a713c,21494213,"This. Is. The. Best. Pizza. Ever. Period. 



Not much more to say. I have eaten pizza all over the US and Europe, Italy included. Antico's is just that great. You order at the counter and proceed to find a seat. They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right. 



Now besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices. 



Now seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!) 



This place is a must try for everyone. Just go!",7/18/2011,270,2,1,5,1,5,11/22/2011,2.8,1,21,1,1,414
e1c08e49cccc3a2816ab0f141d9a713c,21487739,"Absolutely amazing!! I love this place so much, the pizza is just phenomenal. 



They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max. 

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves. 



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D 



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance! 



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.

I judge a pizza place by their Margherita because it's a simple pizza that should be done right and Antico did a great job with the Margherita. The Sophia, which is bufala, cipollini onions, roasted mushrooms, and white truffle oil, has a ton of flavor and is a great pizza for vegetarians.

They don't don't have servers or a bar but byob is fine by me and I love that you can grab a couple plastic cups and sit at a table with friends to wait (not long) for your delicious thin crusted slab of cheesy carb-y goodness. 



We always order the Diablo pizza that has spicy calabrese peppers and spicy meat. It's literally life changing. 

Having the small condiments bar in the 'kitchen' to grab extra toppings is key. 



Raw garlic & extra calabrese peppers? 

Yes please! 



They open stoves from Italy are a great landscape to the true Italian pizza and flavor unmatched by any pizzeria or joint in Atlanta.

When we arrived, there was quite a line and nearly all the community seating was taken. We placed our order and then stood like vultures next to a table until someone left, but surprisingly the turnover was good. Thankfully, we had brought our own bottle of wine which we opened (no corkage fee) and had a little pre-pizza drink from the complimentary plastic cups. 



The pizza that we ordered, the Diavola, had red sauce, hot peppers, and spicy sorpressata. It came out on a large tray and we huddled over it as we devoured it. The dough was downright divine, slightly crusty and blackened around the edges but still soft somehow. Toppings were nice too. Pizza was definitely 5 stars. Will come back again. My wife was even asking what we are doing later this week kind of good. 



The only down sides is that it's a little bit crowded and loud, which probably prevents it from being an optimal experience. The back room is fun because you can see the pizzas being made, but you just end up having to yell at the people you are with. Maybe on a weeknight it might be less crowded and loud, so I'll probably try a day other than Friday next time. Maybe this upcoming Monday....",8/15/2010,255,2,1,5,1,5,11/22/2011,2.8,1,21,1,1,414

It's just scrumptious pizzas and tap water from a sink/BYOB at Antico. Order at the counter, tip with cash, sit down next to strangers, and keep your ears open for your number. 



I've noshed on these three pizzas, in order of most favored to somewhat less favored: 

San Gennaro (salsiccia/sausage, dolce piccante pepper/peppadews?, bufala/mozzarella, cipolline/onions) $22--My favorite so far, but I've been eyeing the lasagna for next time. Excellent sauce, yummy sausage. Liked the peppers. The crust is superb. 



Napoletana (broccoli rabe, salsiccia, bufala) $21--This pizza doesn't come with tomato sauce. I missed the sauce, but I really liked the huge hunks of sausage and felt semi-healthy for eating vegetables. Recommended. 



Diavola (spicy sopressata, pepperonata, bufala), $22--Spice lovers, this is your pie. A little too hot for me, but those with more tolerant tongues will be pleased. 



Pizzas are slightly salty. Antico chars the crust a bit so you will end up with sooty smudges on your fingers, if you're not a knife and forker. The pizzas are thin and have about eight slices to a pie. A person could eat roughly half of a pie; the pizzas come in just one size. 



Don't show up too late since the dough sometimes runs out. The women taking your orders and bringing you your pies are detached but not rude or anything.

We headed to the main dining area (with the open kitchen) and stood by the walk-in freezer for a few minutes, as every table was full. (If you are sitting at a table, it seems that the general rule is to avoid eye contact with standing folks waiting to be seated.) Our pizzas came out; panic set in - we were still standing. 



A member of the kitchen staff led us to the back ""table,"" which isn't really a nice table. It's steel and there are no chairs/stools. But there are paper towels and utensils, so we didn't complain!

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. 



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. 



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time. 



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? 



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted. 



Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? 



This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted.

First, the pizza. Ingredients were okay, but not amazing. The cook on both pizzas was very uneven, like they forgot to turn them before one side burned. The other sides came out undercooked. The sauce was thin and poorly distributed. The middle of the pie was soggy upon serving. 



Other considerations: 



The counter service is poorly thought out. 

Do I grab my own drink? What will you bring to the table? Where are the cups? What if I just want water? How is wine served? Why is this so freaking hard? 



The HVAC can't keep up. 

We went in May and the place was burning up inside. Too hot to be comfortable or maintain an appetite. We ended up leaving after we ate our first slices.

b23f679c6f835bf31f4858880a5be852,16086187,"Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Antico is the real deal - an authentic Neapolitan pizzeria that serves up pies so delicious, you'll be spoiled for life. Their thin-crust masterpieces are baked to perfection in an imported Sicilian oven, lathered with a fabulous assortment of sauces, cheeses, peppers, and served piping hot to your table. Their San Gennaro pie is my favorite, with Italian sausage, mozzarella and hot peppers. The more traditional Margherita, a basic serving of sauce, basil and cheese, is also excellent. There's also a modest wine and bottled beer selection to pair with your meal. 



The setting isn't fancy -- most of the long communal tables are in the kitchen, so you can watch these pizza artisans work while you wait for your meal. Ample outdoor seating is also available in a patio across the street, next to their wonderful coffee and dessert shop. Don't forget to make a stop there afterward for some of the best gelato you'll ever taste this side of Italy. 



Next time you're in Atlanta, make a pilgrimage down to the West Side to enjoy some of the best pizza you'll ever have. Antico definitely lives up to the hype.",3/27/2011,79,3,2,5,6,7,8/19/2011,4.6,1,20,1,NA,265

Whoever the cashier was, she was not polite to any new patron. Antico has rules around their pizza toppings, and it is on the board and on the menu, but when people are looking at the menu, they aren't necessarily reading all the fine print, they are getting straight to their meal! I, unfortunately, was one of those people who had asked one too many questions for this employee who obviously had much more valuable time and other ways to spend it. This experience alone was so bad I docked two stars. She even tried to publicly shame us by shouting at the top of her voice her incredibly condescending answers. Who does that? 



We ordered our pizza, got our wine, and the pizza came out quick. We also easily found a spot to sit which we were lucky because of how crowded it was.

b23f679c6f835bf31f4858880a5be852,3297542,"I'm gonna be honest. I'm an Asian American student, not a pizza connoisseur. If you were to hold me at gunpoint and ask me where Naples is, I won't be able tell you. But I will give you my honest opinion, free of glitter and fancy words. 



The restaurant is always busy around the clock; the line was out the door when my party got there (5pm on a Saturday). Wait time however was pretty quick, and seats weren't all too hard to find. It's BYOB, but if you forget, they also sell a few beverages, like pellegrino. If you're too cheap for drinks, they have plastic cups at each table, and faucet water to drink (literally they pointed to a faucet when I asked for water). 



They don't come short when it comes to the quality of ingredients. The whole business is entirely transparent. There's a rack of proofing dough in plain sight when you walk into the dining room, and ovens blazing in the back. The toppings were even top notch qualities, the pickled peppers were tasty, garlic was fresh, and the parmesan was good (I got an extra cup to eat separately). 



The pizzas are roughly $20 a pie. That's kinda pricey, for a student like me. It's roughly a medium size delivery pizza, and can feed 2 people comfortably (they're not that small). From what I read in the reviews, there are 3 pizzas that yelpers would die for. If you wanna be safe, go for the margherita pizza. If you're fine with anything, get the San Gennaro. If you're a bit adventurous, order the Diavola. The pizzas come out really quick, so find seats ASAP. 



DIAVOLA - $21 

So I ordered the diavola pizza with my girlfriend. The pizza was topped with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. In English, it was topped with some fancy pepperoni, spicy peppers, and fancy mozzarella cheese (sorry guys). The sopressata salami tasted a lot like regular pepperoni, just a tad bit more fattier and more savory, but not a whole lot difference. The peppers were a nice addition, and had a little sweetness that added to the pizza. The bufala tasted like regular mozzarella, I couldn't really tell the difference. The problem I had with this pizza was that it was really salty. I didn't taste any balance in flavors, just the saltiness from the sopressata. To add to that, the pizza was a bit on the dry side and oily on top, contributing to the need for water or some other beverage. The crust was a bit thick for me, compared to the rest of the pizza. 



I tried the margherita pizza, which I thought was better than the diavola pizza. It was simple and classic: not much you can mess up on. Also, try to eat the pizzas as quickly as possible, as they tend to turn soggy the longer you wait. In the end, I wasn't amazed by the pizzas, they were just okay. Basically my two cents is this: as a yelper virgin to authentic Italian food, I'm not sure if this place is worth the hype. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm in the area, but for now, I'd suggest trying one of the other amazing restaurants in Midtown.",3/18/2010,85,3,2,5,6,7,8/19/2011,4.6,1,20,1,NA,265
8c393982479748c5a53acaa7a3717c71,20989641,"So I've lived in Atlanta for almost 7 years, and yet, I'd never experienced Antico. I know, I know.....it's been a long time coming, but finally I got there. My pizza demon got too strong, and I succumb to the pressure, and went for pizza on Sunday afternoon. Besides the fact that the pizza was AWESOME, I hadn't heard anything about Antico. This review is more about what they are missing, versus what you actually get. Yes, the pizza is AH-MAZ-ING...like, INCREDIBLE....probably the best pizza I've had outside of NYC. If you want a great pie, you cannot go wrong with Antico. Period. Now, for what I wasn't prepared for: 



So immediately, the menu seemed way too complex to be a pizza shop. I get it...they want to keep the integrity of the Italian theme and ingredients, and I dig it, but it took me way too long to figure out how to order the pizza I wanted. Even with the help of the staff, it took a while for me to understand. There aren't any substitutions, so what you see is exactly what you get, and you will deal, or you will go elsewhere. At some point, I believe folks will just go elsewhere. You cannot customize your pie in any way....again, WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). I asked about having a pie with half marinara, and half ""white"" sauce, and was told that wasn't possible. That was disappointing. And again, I get designing a menu for an experience, and wanting the patron to have the most authentic experience possible, but I also want the freedom to make my own choices with my pie! LOL LOL. I was also disappointed that there was no fountain drinks....yup, only bottles, and no ice....seriously...you don't have ICE for the drinks? Yes, they are cold, but again, what's the issue with having some convenience. Finally, the price point is pretty high for pizza. I ordered a margherita pizza and added pepperoni ($4 upcharge), with a Coke Zero.....I paid over $29!

This was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I loved that the crust is so chewy and fluffy and the pizza dough was also chewy. Not too much cheese and the crust was nice and thin. I loved that the dining area is mixed in with the oven area and you can watch them bake the pizzas. I've had pizza in Italy and this pizza tastes just as authentic and delicious. 



The pizza came within 5 minutes after ordering and I also love that there are no plates and you just eat right off the trays. Instead, they the option of using a fork and knife and plenty of paper towels.

Before you go to Antico, you need to expect a few things so you will have a good time. Mostly, just know that it's not your average pizza place. 



Seating is quite limited. You may have to share a table with people you don't know. Also, you may want to plan to take your pizza to go as backup, but you can bring your pizza to tables nearby outside (such as the café across the street). 



It's pretty loud. It gets super busy, and most of the indoor seating is in a pretty echo-y room. 



If you order to go, listen closely for them to call your order. This goes along with how loud it is in there. A few people didn't hear when their orders were ready. 



Some people may see these traits as negative, but to me, they are just part of a unique and delicious pizza experience. 



My only real negatives were related to service and price. You sort of need an orientation to eat there ""correctly,"" and the cashier seemed a little put out with our questions. Also, it's a little on the sorbet side for pizza, but I won't deny that it's really good product.

There's something about the sauce they use that makes their pizzas extra delicious and special, not to mention they make their pizzas fresh & you can really taste it in the dough (YUM). You order at the counter then seat yourself; it's pretty much always packed but it doesn't take long to find a spot. The best part about this place is that it's BYOB, so grab a bottle of wine/pack of beer & some buddies and head on over!! 



Now onto the food, you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but my favorite is the classic margherita. I usually like to add some extra toppings such as pepperoni or sausage, but it's delicious just by itself too! All of their pizzas are pretty simple (not too many crazy toppings), but they are all so savory (again... it's the sauce!) that you really don't need the extra toppings! 



Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;) 



Price: Around $20ish for a whole pizza so some may think it's a bit pricey but trust me when I say it's absolutely worth the deliciousness!!!",2/7/2011,108,3,3,2,4,2,2/24/2011,2.8,0,30,1,NA,42

I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars for two reasons. First, I think it's way over priced. One pizza is around $22. Also, it's hard to find a place to sit here. It's a smaller building and it's usually pretty busy. I recommend coming here in a small group, or just getting your pizza to go.

The open concept and seating is also pretty unique. Since the kitchen is basically in the eating area, it gets pretty hot in the room so just be warned! But the air is just filled with amazing pizza smells and aromas. The tables are family style and first come first serve so you never know who will be sitting beside you.

Pizza and calzones, no salad. One cooler of sodas, another cooler of every flavor of San Pellegrino fizzy water. And they have both beer and wine available. We ordered the Diavolo pizza and our number was called a few minutes later, with the pizza brought to our table. 



Antico is community seating in a very loud and very boisterous room in the back. If you're sensitive to noise, perhaps somewhere else would be better for you. On a busy weeknight, it was hopping and the seats at the tables turned over very quickly. One of the staff also came by to pick up dirty trays and empty bottles. 



As for the pizza, wow. Thin crust, Neapolitan style, well topped with delicious toppings. The red peppers and the spicy sopressata made for a very hot pizza. Those peppers had some serious kick. The crust was excellent and the two of us split the one pie with only a slight challenge.

We came here and I was pretty impressed that the pizza place and across there's gelato and a few small ""Italian"" inspired shops that are all owned by the same person. 



Pricing: the pizzas are NOT cheap first of all. However they are very large and feed a lot of people. For us there was 20 and we ordered 7 pizzas so it wasn't TOO bad. 



Pizza: overall the pizza was pretty good! I wasn't too fond of the burnt tasting crust on just about every slice and a lot of us left the crust uneaten. The toppings were interestingly thrown on. Some slices had a massive bunch of tomatoes or pepperonis and some had like little to none. Lol. 



Service: service was SUPER QUICK. Like wow. Couldn't believe how fast they were. And I'm pretty sure they make to order because you can taste it. And it was a busy evening but across from the pizza shop there is the plaza with other shops and lots of extra seating. And because it's the same owner it works out with being allowed to sit elsewhere. 



However adding on to service, afterwards I wanted to help pick things up and clean up a bit cause you figure it's the courteous thing to do since they've been so busy. They used very large metal trays to hold the pizza and I wanted to carry it back for them. As I was bringing them inside the pizza restaurant a gal who worked there was coming out saw me and started getting mad at me. Saying things like ""why are you doing that?"" Why? Just no."" And I was like ""oh the people who work across said I could bring it over..."" and she was so RUDE. Kept saying I shouldn't have done that and shouldn't be helping out. LOL. What??! Ok. And I'm sorry if I was out of line somehow by helping out? We had massive loads of trash on all of the trays and I just wanted to make it a bit easier for them.

They had a little canopy tent to wait under so you were in the shade/protected from any rain...which I thought was pretty considerate. But the cherry on top for me is when at about 11:55, a lady comes out of the building carrying two huge trays of pizza, and walks around offering people slices. Not only are they sheltering me...but feeding me before I even enter the building???? How awesome!!! 



You walk in, order your food at the counter.There are few menu offerings...but I think this is what makes them so efficient as a business.(they specialize in just a few things, and do them incredibly well) I ordered the San Gennaro pizza.

Our friends that live near Atlanta Station have visited Antico and have raved. We were nervous for the wait on a Saturday night but thankfully the line moved quickly. 



The concept is brilliant. Everyone orders at the counter and then finds themselves a seat in the main dining room with an open kitchen. 



We ordered Margherita with Funghi (mushrooms) and Pomodorini for the 5 of us. (On another day, 2 pies wouldn't have been enough for 5 adults but this particular day we were all semi-full from a day of non stop eating.) We found seating quickly and promptly opened our bottle of wine. Antico is BYOB, bring your own booze, but I believe they sell beer. Just to be ""safe"", we brought our own wine opener and would recommend others to do the same. 



The pizza was brought out, soon after order, by one of the servers that walk around calling the order numbers. The pizza is served on a large sheet pan. Once we had our first bite, we were fans. 



From BYOB, ordering food at the counter and seat yourself, serving pizza on sheet pans rather than plates all enhances the concept and emphasizes serving the best food possible.

What is also amazing is that the pizza comes out in 2 minutes (talk about lightening fast).

We were lucky (coming at around 2PM) that we were able to find seating, but about 3PM, there was an insane line outside the door.

Granted, we're coming from a perspective of people who grew up on NYC pizza, so we're probably biased. If you're from the Northeast, then you know how crazy we can be about our pizza. Unfortunately, Antico just doesn't compare to little Italy Or our local, corner pizza spot (I promise...no shade, really). But, perhaps that's not the comparison I should be making, in all fairness. From an Atlanta perspective, I tend to like Rosa's Pizza downtown for a close NYC approximation. And, I wanted to love Antico's Bianca and Lasagna Pizzas so much, but I didn't :-(.

You go up to the counter, order your pies, get a drink, grab a seat if there isn't a line and then they yell out your number. There are condiments aka garlic, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and hot peppers by the ovens to which you can help yourself. 



Knocked off one star because of two reasons. First, I understand this can't be helped but they don't allow split pizzas-aka one side one style and the other half another style. So if you're a veg eater and your Boo eats meat, you gotta just get two pies. 



Secondly, why are the dang pies so expensive?! This isn't NYC. For a pie, the price is anywhere from $18-20. They sell hundreds of pies a day. So much profit. I wish they were more plebian-friendly. It makes the whole experience centered on hipster-, nouveau riche-, Subaru-driving people only.

Crust, sauce and cheese with basil. Everything was perfect. 

The establishment is half the fun--it's lively, the kitchen is a constant flurry of cooks, busboys and customers. You typically will eat right in the kitchen! The 3 large stone ovens are within sight and you can watch your pizza get made. the kitchen is set up with large benches so you eat in close proximity to other patrons if it is busy. 



It's not a romantic establishment by any means but it can still be a great date night. If you don't want to deal with the crowd (which I actually quite enjoyed) then get it to go. You don't have to order ahead--it is that fast and it'd probably taste better fresher. 



Pizzas are ready in about 5 minutes. I've never seen a more efficient restaurant but with excellent food. I will definitely be back next year during dragon con 2018!

First, the pizza. Ingredients were okay, but not amazing. The cook on both pizzas was very uneven, like they forgot to turn them before one side burned. The other sides came out undercooked. The sauce was thin and poorly distributed. The middle of the pie was soggy upon serving. 



Other considerations: 



The counter service is poorly thought out. 

Do I grab my own drink? What will you bring to the table? Where are the cups? What if I just want water? How is wine served? Why is this so freaking hard? 



The HVAC can't keep up. 

We went in May and the place was burning up inside. Too hot to be comfortable or maintain an appetite. We ended up leaving after we ate our first slices. 



The seating is tortuous. 

Clearly they want you to pay, eat, and leave immediately. No seats with backs. Just hard backless benches and stools that make your butt and back hurt. Not even remotely relaxing. 



The noise never stops. 

I understand that rampant shouting is was passes for ""vibrancy"" in restaurants today, but it's a trend I hate and one that hope will die soon. You can't have a conversation with your meal. It's just too damned loud.

Pros: PIZZA duh, fast 

Cons: seatings, self-service (water, seasonings, sides), price 



I visited here probably for ten times, and I can only imagine going here more. 

SERVICE: When I walk in, I am always greeted by the cashiers. They're nice and helpful when choosing what to eat because the menu is in Italian. I often opt for margherita (fresh mozzarella with basil) or meat-with-red-pepper pizzas. Maybe I should memorize pizza names by now. // After you order, you can sit anywhere in the store, and wait until someone calls your order number! They always serve you in a large tin tray. 

FOODS: Mine came out always in less than 15 minutes. While you're waiting, go grab your water near the kitchen, and sides {parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, salt, olive oil, and spicy peppers}. The dough is chewy and perfect. The things ON THE PIZZA tend to be salty, including but not limited to its tomato sauce, sausage, and peppers. The crusts on the bottom may be burnt and your fingers may be turned black and ashy. Portion size wise, if you get full after eating 3 Papa Johns Pizza, you may need to eat half of the pizza. Antico's pizzas are thin, and moist in the center. 



I heard the flour comes from Italy! And the owner owns other restaurants, too. There was a news about Antico's closing due to legal issues with the owner, but it's still up and open! I hope this place never closes. Few suggestions to the restaurant is - expand the place with outdoor seatings and make larger pizzas so people can share with less price.

Ok, I will. Their pizzas are amazing, but beware, you cannot ask for them to change the pizzas and remove or add toppings really... They are made how they are and that's that. But trust them, they know what they are doing. 



You order your pizza at the register then go inside and pick a table. The tables are long picnic tables and so you may have to get cozy with others. That's ok though, it's good to meet other people. The pizzas come out pretty quick, because they only make a few different types. The pizzas are fresh and delicious, made in pizza ovens. My only complaint is that the pizzas are expensive. My husband and I came here for lunch one day and spent $25 on a pizza, granted we had 2 pieces leftover, but it's too pricey for me to do as often as I would like... which I guess is a good thing for my waistline!",1/14/2011,82,3,4,3,5,5,6/2/2011,4,0,21,1,NA,182

I had hoped to experience the pizza promised by the high number of fans. But no. Nothing changed. What I see is a restaurant that probably delivered in quality and experienced before it got hit with high reviews and explosive amount of business. And it has just not delivered he quality pizza, probably because it has too much business. Ironic huh? 



Specifically, I've been back 4 more times since my first review. And 4 times I've gotten pizza that's thin, soggy, sometimes okay, but never close to the expectations set by the reviews I see. I'm still looking for the ultimate pizza experience in Atlanta, but sadly, Antico doesn't deliver. I say this because I would be overjoyed if it delivered pizza as good as the reviews I've seen.

9e3ac40f6af27e0a640a11baaea65091,19750784,"Antico's Pizza with our friends from Korea. 

They loved the pizza here. We ordered 4 different ones to try out. We ordered the Lasagna, Margherita D.O. P., Diavola, and San Gennaro. 



The Margherita pizza has San Marzano tomato, bufala, basil and garlic on it. My fave! I usually ask for more fresh basil and lay it on my pizza, fold my pizza over and dip it in the oil that I make. I use spicy olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese to make a dipping sauce. It is a bit spicy but I love a pizza with a kick. 



The Lasagna pizza has meatballs, ricotta and romano on it. This was my fiancé's favorite one. 



The San Gennaro has salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala and cipolline on it. This was the least popular one. 



The Diavola has spicy sopressata, pepperonata and bufala on it. This was our friend's fave one. It was a bit spicy so you really don't need the spicy oil dip for this one! He liked it because it was spicy. 



I was super hungry when I ordered 4. It was way too much pizza for 4 people. Next time we will order 2. Their portion is large, their pizza is not small. 



Seating is always a problem here. We waited a while to find seats. I wish they would do something about this seating issue at Antico's. I love the pizza but seating is such a pain to deal with. Buttttttttt I will be back for this yummy pizza!!",10/31/2010,195,3,4,3,5,5,6/2/2011,4,0,21,1,NA,182

There is no question in my mind that I've had better pizza in the city of Atlanta and its surrounding area. Now, don't get me wrong -- the pizza is fine. The ingredients are fresh, the crust/dough is flavorful, the restaurant has lots of character. The service is quick. Although you will most likely encounter long lines, you will not wait long for food at all. 



I've had the San Gennaro and Diavola pizzas. If I find myself at Antico again in the near future (because, let's face it, everybody seems to want to check this place out nowadays...so I'm sure friends will make me go again at some point) I will try one of the white pizzas. Perhaps I just haven't stumbled upon my perfect pizza at Antico :-(

After we sat down, I noticed that other people had brought in wine so it must be a BYOB as well.

Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great...

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico) 

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis) 

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns). 

*there are other pizza types but this is a rough categorization without getting too granular (new york, chicago, etc.)

I always order the margherita. 

Crust, sauce and cheese with basil. Everything was perfect. 

The establishment is half the fun--it's lively, the kitchen is a constant flurry of cooks, busboys and customers. You typically will eat right in the kitchen! The 3 large stone ovens are within sight and you can watch your pizza get made. the kitchen is set up with large benches so you eat in close proximity to other patrons if it is busy. 



It's not a romantic establishment by any means but it can still be a great date night. If you don't want to deal with the crowd (which I actually quite enjoyed) then get it to go. You don't have to order ahead--it is that fast and it'd probably taste better fresher. 



Pizzas are ready in about 5 minutes. I've never seen a more efficient restaurant but with excellent food. I will definitely be back next year during dragon con 2018!

Another highlight is the toppings bar - spicy peppers, freshly ground pepper and red pepper, garlic, olive oil, chili oil, and of course, parmesan. There's nothing better than devouring your pizza and then being able to drench your chewy, smoky crust in garlic. Perfection. 



The vibe is quite hectic - but it's a fun vibe. There's always a line but it goes really fast. You have to wait for a table, but again, spots open up quickly. One downside is the parking, which is quite sparse in the lot as well as the street parking. it's worth it, just be prepared to stalk a spot or uber. Which brings me to my next point.
